      <h1>ORDERING SERVICES</h1>
      <p>
        My professional services as a Graphic Designer are here for individuals
        and companies seeking custom made artwork that shows real creative
        experience and produces real results at really great prices. Companies
        or individuals that need custom designs or artwork created regularly
        love my low cost services that are based on how involved a design will
        be. Companies that already have their own art department can also use my
        creative services when there are too many orders for their department
        alone to handle. My skills and years of experience are here when you
        need them. My hope is that you will view my designer services and
        continued support of your artwork as your very own art department. There
        are a number of companies who use my services regularly when they need a
        Vector Artist to clean up or recreate artwork for printing, a Shirt
        Designer for a line of graphic T-shirts or just a personal Illustrator
        for any number of custom creative projects.

        At Special Forces Art Department I treat every project seriously with a
        carefully thought out, strategic plan of action developed to produce the
        most vivid results at a great price. If you are looking for the fastest
        Logo Designer or the least expensive quote to get your brochure created
        then this may not be the place for you. If however, you are looking for
        properly created, professional artwork and designs with great results
        you can easily see then smile, because you are going to have a great
        experience here!

        Here every project is made to print at the highest level of quality
        possible for the intended printing process. All files are prepared using
        printing industry standards to insure that your printing company will
        have no problems reproducing your designs. All printing companies have
        their own specifications for how they need artwork prepared. If there is
        ever a problem with your files, you or your printing company can always
        contact me to get the problem resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every custom made illustration project is also constructed to produce
        the highest print quality possible. All illustrations are made to order
        as fully or mostly vector artwork depending on your project's specific
        requirements. Vector artwork is basically any art that is created using
        a computer program rather than photographed or scanned into a computer.
        Vector art will print at the highest possible image quality and it has a
        number of other advantages that make it a superior format for
        illustrations and designs. It is also the format that printing companies
        love and usually require.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every project you order here is custom developed through a process of
        proofing. The proofing process is critical to a successful project. It
        is a visual way to verify that everything is going according to plan and
        that nothing has been misunderstood between client and Graphic Designer
        during the creation of your project.
      </p>

        When you request a price quote here I may ask you some questions that
        will help me to provide an accurate quote. After you approve your quote
        I get started, typically on a rough proof to begin with but some
        projects can be taken to a final draft proof right away. The rough proof
        may contain a few possible starting point directions for your design. If
        it looks like we have a good start, I develop it into a final draft
        proof. The proofing process does not stop until you love your finished
        artwork. If during the proofing process, the changes you request differ
        from what was originally discussed then your quote may also need to be
        adjusted accordingly. I will always inform you of a change to your quote
        before we proceed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most average sized projects take about 2 to 3 business days to complete
        depending on the complexity and how well the proofing process goes.
        Quick adjustments to a design are usually returned the same day they are
        requested. Initial proofs are typically ready within 1 to 2 business
        days after your project is started or your down payment (if required)
        has been received.
