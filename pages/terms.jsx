      <p>
        These Terms of Service were last modified on 1-1-2021. By accepting a
        quote, proceeding with a project or entering into business of any kind
        with Special Forces Art Department you are agreeing to the following
        terms of service. It is recommended that you review these terms each
        time you place an order incase updates have been made. If you are
        placing an order in the name of a company, organization or another
        person (for example your own customer) you must be legally authorized to
        do so. Upon completion of your project, your payment will be due even if
        you do not receive payment from the company, organization or person that
        you placed the order for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically payment is not due until you approve your finished design
        however for orders larger than $200 a deposit may be required to begin
        your project. If you are unsatisfied with my services before approval of
        your project we can discuss what went wrong and if we cannot come to a
        satisfactory resolution about the problem, you will be refunded any
        deposit made towards your project. This refund does not include any
        extra expenses that may have been purchased for your project. If you do
        cancel an order you will not be eligible to receive this or any other
        offer/promotional price on any future services provided by Special
        Forces Art Department and prepayment will be required for all future
        orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Approval can take many forms but any communication indicating that you
        are satisfied with the design will constitute approval. Always check
        your proofs thoroughly as Special Forces Art Department will not be held
        responsible for any errors found in a design after it is approved. Once
        you have approved your final draft proof your payment will be due and
        your option to cancel the order becomes null and void. Discontinuing
        communications with Special Forces Art Department during a project does
        not constitute a cancellation of your order in any way. If all attempts
        to reach you regarding an unfinished project remain unanswered for 30
        days or more then your project will be considered completed and you will
        be sent your invoice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your quote will be based on a plan that we discuss before your project
        is started. Revisions are a normal part of the design process however,
        if the plan we discussed changes during the process then your quote will
        also be subject to change. I will always inform you of any change to
        your quote before proceeding so you will never receive a bill that is
        larger than you expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Full payment is due upon initial approval of your final draft proof and
        before you will receive your actual design files for use. Invoices not
        paid in full within 15 days of your project's initial approval will be
        charged a 1.5% per month interest charge. Further adjustments to your
        project after approval do not extend your payment due date in any way.
        If payment is ever past due then you may be required to make
        pre-payments on all future orders and you will forfeit any special
        pricing (such as contract or bulk rate pricing) for all future orders.
        All artwork and designs (including modifications to existing artwork)
        are the property of Special Forces Art Department (the business identity
        of the Graphic Designer working on your project) until full payment has
        been received. Once paid in full, you may use the artwork you purchased
        here in any way you see fit. Other Graphic Designers will charge you
        based on how much you plan to use your artwork or how many pieces you
        have printed. I have never felt this was a logical way to charge for
        design work. All prices here are based on how complex the art or design
        is to be. The more complex something is the longer it takes to complete,
        therefore, the higher the quote will be. Logical and simple with no
        restrictions on how you use your designs once they are paid in full. I,
        the Graphic Designer hold the right to display any designs I created in
        my portfolio. If you do not want your design displayed just let me know
        in advance and I will respect your wishes.
      </p>

        This is a place to request the services of a professional Graphic
        Designer online. You will receive your artwork as digital files that
        meet or exceed printing industry standards. If multiple files are
        required we will need to get your printing company's specifications
        before we begin. If you change printing companies or the printing
        specifications change then there may be additional charges to reformat
        your files. This is not a printing company and no printed reproductions
        will be provided as part of your purchase. The digital files you
        purchase here will be setup according to printing industry standards or
        as specified by your printing company. If your printing company ever has
        a problem with one of your files they can always contact me, your
        Graphic Designer. Projects are not copyrighted here however a copyright
        release letter will be furnished upon request after full payment has
        been made. In the case of embroidery your files will need to be
        digitized by your embroidery company (which they may charge you for).
        The files created by Special Forces Art Department are not embroidery
        files.

        If you are located in Pennsylvania, or request a physical print or disc
        of your project from me, it is Pennsylvania law that I add an additional
        6% Sales Tax to your original quote.
