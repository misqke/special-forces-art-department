      <h1>WHY USE A GRAPHIC DESIGNER?</h1>
      <p>
        Graphic Designers actually create a wide variety of designs like, vector
        logos, custom made brochures, graphic clothing, signs and a great deal
        more, but we don't just create them, we create them in a way that is
        vivid and memorable to viewers (in other words, "graphic"). More than
        that, creating custom designs is a complex combination of advertising
        principles, psychology and art used to communicate to large masses of
        people or perhaps tailored for a more specific audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you have a design created for your business or advertising there
        should be a logical balance of information and visual persuasion
        present. A certain percentage of the design is intended to persuade or
        entice a viewer while the remaining percentage is intended to inform the
        viewer. For example, if you need a travel brochure created, it would be
        made of persuasive photos and images but would not hold every detail of
        information about the destination in the brochure. That would fill the
        design with words and not leave enough room for those big persuasive
        photos to show off the destination (it uses its layout to persuade you
        to go there - form over function). If you ordered an employee handbook
        design on the other hand, a designer would use very little visual
        persuasion as most of the work would go into the organizing of all the
        text and information making it easier to read and use for its employees
        (function over form).
      </p>
      <p>
        True and professional Graphic Designers would never mass produce or
        quickly make a design using templates or other shortcuts. Rather, they
        would logically develop a custom made design through a careful process
        of proofing and feedback from their client.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pro Graphic Designers utilize a number of principles including but not
        limited to line, shape, mass, hierarchy, color, positive and negative
        space and much more to create the best possible visual communication for
        the intended target audience and the way that audience thinks. A
        professional composition should speak for itself and leave no question
        that a great deal of thought has gone into it. If you have ordered
        custom made designs in the past and not felt this way about your
        finished product then it is likely you did not receive real services.

        Designers use many principles of art to create a visual and verbal
        communication that is both easy to understand and memorable to the
        people it is created for (the target audience). There should be a visual
        and verbal synergy present in a well made piece. It should be custom
        tailored to either a broad or specific range of people depending on what
        the client requires. The target audience could be an age group (created
        to be young and wild verses mature and refined designs). The gender of a
        person could be the target (women's clothing verses men's tools).
        Sometimes the audience is not so easy to see. It could just be a certain
        type of person, where they live, what trends of the world attract them
        or just their psychological mindset. A good Designer considers these
        things and much more weather they are creating a single logo or an
        entire advertising campaign.
