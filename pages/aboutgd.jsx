      <h1>ABOUT GRAPHIC DESIGN</h1>
      <p>
        Advertising is not just about saying something, it is about HOW you say
        something. The way it is written is a key factor in relating a layout to
        its intended audience. The audience has to feel they are being spoken to
        by a member of their group if the advertisement is to stick with them
        and be memorable. The type fonts chosen for the project have to be fonts
        that belong in the viewer's world or they will just be dismissed. The
        size, placement and density of words in a layout create a visual
        hierarchy that leads the eye around the layout with little effort from
        the viewer.

        Information and how it is presented is just one part of the big design
        puzzle. So much goes into the visual elements of layout as well. A great
        deal of what happens in a well made logo, happens in the first few
        seconds of viewing it. The gestalt of a piece is the way a brain
        organizes the elements of the composition visually. This normally occurs
        subconsciously when you first look at a logo, sign or any well built
        design. It only takes a few seconds but it can be the most important
        factor in making a layout stick in a viewer's mind. It is also what
        makes a viewer recognize a logo when they see it again (very important
        for company branding). The first few seconds of looking at a sign is
        sometimes all the time a Designer has to attract a viewer or get the
        message across.

        Relating to a target audience and keeping your company identity in their
        minds is tricky work. This is where the "Graphic" comes from in "Graphic
        Designer". A truly "Graphic" Designer will consider these and many more
        factors. Aside from the size, placement and hierarchy of elements in a
        layout, there are countless rules and factors to keep in mind. The
        timing and rhythm of elements in a created composition are as important
        as they are in a great song. And just like a song that has been composed
        properly, a properly created visual communication will stay in the mind
        of the audience. A good Designer knows all the rules of art. And when
        you know all the rules of something, you can then and ONLY THEN, know
        when to bend and break those rules in a way that is productive to the
        project. Good Designers can do this in a way that feels effortless and
        natural. Bad Designers don't even consider these important aspects.
